- Automated API Documentation Updates recently implemented
- [*Coming Soon* - Newznab & All Indexer Definitions to YML - Cardigann v6](https://github.com/Prowlarr/Prowlarr/pull/823)
- Note that users of Newznab (Usenet) Indexers may see that the UI shows Indexers as added that are not.
  - This will be fixed with Cardigann v6 and is due to all the Newznab Indexers sharing the same definition.
